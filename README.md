# Misc. Scripts

This is a set of various one-off scripts written to accomplish specific tasks. These scripts have had minimal testing, have not been peer reviewed, are poorly documented, and are sometimes very experimental. The purpose of this repo is to quickly share things that would otherwise not be shared if doing so required a larger investment to do things like documentation and testing. Accordingly, use with caution.
