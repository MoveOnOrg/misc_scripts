# Kos Imports

This set of Python 3 scripts will import petition signer files from Daily Kos.

Before running, do this:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then copy `settings.py.example` to `settings.py` and fill in your info.

All parameters can be set as environment variables, passed as command-line flags, or set in `settings.py`, and are prioritized in that order. To see all available parameters for a given script, run with `--help`.
